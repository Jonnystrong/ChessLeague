## Abstract
The idea is to develop a chess tournament in which teams of different streamers play against each other.
This will first be done in a group system which will later be replaced by a knockout system. 

## Team structure
The teams consist of 6 players per team. These must be a active viewer of the respective streamer. 
The game is played in different rating groups (1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2200, Streamer).


## Time managment
The streamers have 2 weeks to find a date in the group phase. The dates for the knockout phase will be announced separately.
The streamers have to register for the event in advance. Then they get 1 week to set up their team.
Then the event starts.
All matches must be streamed.
However, as we do not have any registrations yet, the schedules will be announced elsewhere.
